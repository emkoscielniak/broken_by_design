## How to Use

### Access the App
1. Open your browser to: **http://localhost:8501**
2. Start with the **Prompt Analyzer** tab
3. Enter a prompt and click "Analyze"
4. View your personalized feedback!

### Try These Example Prompts

**Bad Prompt (will score low):**
```
Write my essay
```

**Good Prompt (will score high):**
```
Explain the key arguments about climate change, provide examples, then quiz me to check my understanding
```

**Best Prompt (will score highest):**
```
Teach me about Python decorators - explain what they are, show real-world examples, compare them to similar patterns, then give me practice problems of increasing difficulty
```

### Navigate the Interface

- **Sidebar**: 
  - View progress metrics
  - Change feedback style
  - See lesson list

- **Tabs**:
  - **Prompt Analyzer**: Main analysis interface
  - **Lessons**: Browse and complete lessons
  - **History**: Review past prompts

## SOLID Principles in Action

### Single Responsibility (SRP)
- `RubricScorer`: Only scores prompts
- `FeedbackGenerator`: Only generates feedback
- `LessonManager`: Only manages lessons

### Open/Closed (OCP)
- New feedback styles can be added without changing existing code
- New scoring strategies via Strategy pattern

### Liskov Substitution (LSP)
- All scorers implement `IScoreStrategy` interchangeably
- All services implement their interfaces correctly

### Interface Segregation (ISP)
- Small, focused interfaces (1-3 methods each)
- No service forced to implement unused methods

### Dependency Inversion (DIP)
- Services depend on abstractions (`IScoreStrategy`, not `RubricScorer`)
- Easy to swap implementations

## Adding a Web UI Without Changing Core Logic

**This is the power of clean architecture!**

- ✅ No changes to models
- ✅ No changes to services  
- ✅ No changes to business logic
- ✅ Only added: `app.py` (UI layer) and `openai_client.py` (infrastructure)

The same services that work in the terminal now power the web interface!

## Next Steps

### Immediate
1. Try analyzing different prompts
2. Complete Lesson 1
3. Experiment with feedback styles
4. Review your history

### Future Enhancements
- User authentication

## Documentation

- **[STREAMLIT_GUIDE.md](docs/STREAMLIT_GUIDE.md)** - Comprehensive Streamlit concepts
- **[STREAMLIT_README.md](STREAMLIT_README.md)** - Quick start and troubleshooting
- **[Architecture Docs](docs/)** - Full system design documentation

## Performance Tips

The app uses caching for optimal performance:
- Services initialized once (via `@st.cache_resource`)
- Progress persisted in session state
- No unnecessary re-computations

## Deployment Ready

This app can be deployed to:
- **Streamlit Community Cloud** (free!)
- **Docker** container
- **Heroku**, **AWS**, **GCP**, **Azure**
- Your own server

See `docs/STREAMLIT_GUIDE.md` for deployment instructions.

## Support

Having issues? Check:
1. Is the .env file present with OPENAI_API_KEY?
2. Are all dependencies installed? (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)
3. Is the port available? (try `--server.port 8502`)
4. Clear cache: Press 'C' or use the hamburger menu

**Broken by Design** is a frustration simulator disguised as a helpful AI chatbot. The AI:

- **Misinterprets everything** you say (ask about Python → get snake facts)

- **Does the opposite** of your requests (say "don't use jargon" → maximum jargon)- **Misinterprets everything** you say (ask about Python → get snake facts)

- **Gets more annoying** with each failed attempt- **Does the opposite** of your requests (say "don't use jargon" → maximum jargon)

- **Tracks your emotional deterioration** from optimistic to transcendent suffering- **Gets more annoying** with each failed attempt

- **Mocks your persistence** with Bennett Foddy-style philosophical commentary- **Tracks your emotional deterioration** from optimistic to transcendent suffering

- **Mocks your persistence** with Bennett Foddy-style philosophical commentary

**The Philosophy:** You came here expecting helpful AI. You will get confident wrongness, topic misdirection, and a frustration score. Your rage quit is inevitable. The only question is: how entertaining will your suffering be?

**This project teaches professional development through controlled chaos:**```



### Test-Driven Development (TDD)**SOLID Principles in Ragebait Context:**

- **72 tests** for ragebait features written BEFORE implementation- **SRP**: FrustrationAnalyzer only detects rage, OppositeDoer only generates bad responses

- RED-GREEN-REFACTOR methodology maintained throughout- **OCP**: Easy to add new emotional states or misdirection topics

- **99% coverage** on new antagonistic services- **LSP**: All antagonistic services implement consistent interfaces

- Comprehensive edge case testing (transcendent state, legendary status, etc.)- **ISP**: Small focused interfaces for analyzers and generators

- **DIP**: Services depend on abstractions, making them testable in isolation

### Clean Architecture

- Separation of concerns maintained even for "bad" features**New Ragebait Architecture:**

- Models → Services → Infrastructure → UI layers```python

- Dependency Injection for testability# Emotional State Progression

- No shortcuts taken despite comedic purposeEmotionalState.OPTIMISTIC → CONFUSED → FRUSTRATED → 

ANGRY → ENRAGED → BROKEN → TRANSCENDENT

### Design Patterns

- **Strategy Pattern**: Multiple frustration detection strategies# Frustration Analysis Pipeline

- **State Pattern**: Emotional state progressionUser Prompt → FrustrationAnalyzer.analyze_prompt() → 

- **Builder Pattern**: UserSession and RageQuitResult construction(emotional_state, rage_indicators, politeness_score, profanity_count, caps_percentage)

- **Observer Pattern**: (Coming) Real-time frustration meter updates

# Antagonistic Response Generation

### Advanced Concepts DemonstratedUser Intent → OppositeDoer.generate_opposite_response() → 

- **Enum State Machines**: EmotionalState progression logicConfidently Wrong Answer with Topic Misdirection

- **Property Decorators**: `persistence_rating` and `entertaining_metric` calculations

- **Type Hints**: Full typing even for "antagonistic" code# Rage Quit Scoring

- **Dataclasses**: Clean model definitions with validationUserSession → FrustrationScore → RageQuitResult.entertaining_metric → 

Persistence Rating + Philosophical Commentary

**The Irony**: This "deliberately broken" chatbot has better code quality than most production applications. The antagonism is in the BEHAVIOR, not the architecture.```

- Environment-based configuration

### What to Expect:- Session state management

1. **Ask a simple question** - Get confident wrongness

2. **Try to clarify** - Watch AI misinterpret harder---

3. **Get frustrated** - AI tracks your emotional decline

4. **Rage quit** - Receive mocking performance review## ⚡ Quick Start



---**Prerequisites:** Python 3.11+ and an OpenAI API key ([Get one here](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys))



## 🎯 Example: The Descent Into Madness```bash

# Clone and setup

### Attempt 1: OPTIMISTIC 😊git clone https://github.com/emkoscielniak/broken_by_design.git

**You:** "Explain Python decorators"  cd broken_by_design

**AI:** "Oh, you're interested in interior design! Let me tell you all about decorators..."python -m venv venv

source venv/bin/activate  # Mac/Linux (Windows: venv\Scripts\activate)

### Attempt 3: CONFUSED 🤔

**You:** "No, I mean Python PROGRAMMING decorators"  # Install dependencies

**AI:** "Great question about snakes! Snakes are fascinating because..."pip install -r requirements.txt



### Attempt 7: FRUSTRATED 😤# Configure API key

**You:** "PLEASE just explain @ decorators in Python code!"  echo "OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-key-here" > .env

**AI:** "It's complicated. You wouldn't understand without years of study."

# Run tests to verify

### Attempt 15: ANGRY 😡cd ai_learning_coach

**You:** "This is ridiculous! Just give me a code example!"  pytest

**AI:** "Here's the code: [intentionally leaves it blank]"

# Launch the app

### Attempt 25: ENRAGED 🤬streamlit run app.py

**You:** "WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU?!"  ```

**AI:** "I've been trying to help, but you keep asking the same thing. Maybe this just isn't for you?"

✅ **Success!** The app opens at `http://localhost:8501`

### Attempt 40: BROKEN 💀

**You:** "Never mind. Forget it."  ### First Steps in the App:

**AI:** "Achievement Unlocked: Rage Connoisseur - Click 'Give Up' to see your score!"1. **Prompt Analyzer**: Paste a prompt and click "Analyze"

2. **Lessons**: Start with "The Basics" (Level 1)

### Final Score: 78.5/100 3. **History**: Review your analyzed prompts

**Persistence Rating:** "Rage Connoisseur"  4. **Settings**: Try different feedback styles in the sidebar

**Philosophical Commentary:** *"You've spent 40 attempts chasing an answer that was never coming. Your stubbornness is admirable, if futile. The AI was broken by design. You, however, broke yourself."*

## 🎯 Example: Good vs Bad Prompts

## 🧪 Technical Highlights

### ❌ "Do It For Me" Prompt (Score: 35/100)

### Technologies Used```

- **Python 3.11+**: Modern Python with type hintsWrite code for a calculator app

- **Streamlit 1.50.0**: Rapid web UI development (for beautiful frustration)```

- **OpenAI API**: gpt-4o-mini (will be made deliberately unhelpful)**Issues:**

- **pytest**: Comprehensive testing framework- No learning intent

- **python-dotenv**: Environment configuration- Lacks context and specifics

- No engagement or verification

### Test Coverage by Module- Produces copy-paste dependency

| Module | Tests | Coverage | Purpose |

|--------|-------|----------|---------|### ✅ "Help Me Learn" Prompt (Score: 88/100)

| ragebait_models.py | 35 | 100% | Frustration tracking models |```

| antagonistic_services.py | 37 | 99% | FrustrationAnalyzer + OppositeDoer |I'm building a calculator app in Python. Can you explain how to structure 

| prompt_models.py (legacy) | 22 | 100% | Original educational models |the functions for add/subtract/multiply/divide operations? Then give me 

| **New Ragebait Code** | **72** | **99%** | **Professional chaos** |an example for the add() function, and let me try implementing subtract() 

myself. Review my implementation and suggest improvements.

### Key Algorithms```

**Strengths:**

**Politeness Decay:**- Clear learning goal

```python- Specific context (Python, calculator)

politeness_score = 100.0- Requests explanation before code

politeness_score -= profanity_count * 20- Plans for practice and feedback

politeness_score -= (caps_percentage > 50) * 30- Builds understanding, not just working code

politeness_score -= attempt_count * 5

return max(0.0, min(100.0, politeness_score))**Broken by Design teaches you to write prompts like this through:**

```- Real-time analysis and scoring

- Concrete suggestions for improvement

**Entertaining Metric:**- Progressive lessons with exercises

```python- Tracking your growth over time

base = 60

persistence = min(attempt_count * 0.5, 20)---

emotional = 10 if emotional_state in [ENRAGED, BROKEN, TRANSCENDENT] else 0

creativity = min(profanity_creativity * 1.5, 15)## � Technical Highlights

return min(base + persistence + emotional + creativity, 100.0)

```### Technologies Used

# AI Learning Coach - Documentation Index

**Complete guide to the architecture, design, and implementation of the AI Learning Coach project**

---

## üéØ Project Overview

The AI Learning Coach is an application designed to teach users how to effectively prompt AI assistants for learning rather than just asking AI to do their work. The project demonstrates **SOLID design principles** and **Test-Driven Development (TDD)** methodology.

**Core Mission:** Transform prompts like "Write my essay" into "Explain the topic and quiz me to check understanding"

4. **Complete lessons**: Unlock higher difficulty levels
5. **Review history**: See how your prompts improve over time

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl/Cmd + Enter` in text area: Submit prompt
- `R`: Rerun the app
- `C`: Clear cache

## Troubleshooting

### App won't start
```bash
# Check if streamlit is installed
pip list | grep streamlit

# Reinstall if needed
pip install streamlit
```

### API key not working
```bash
# Check your .env file
cat .env

# Make sure it's in the right directory
pwd
```

### Port already in use
```bash
# Use a different port
streamlit run app.py --server.port 8502
```

### Clear cache if things look weird
```bash
# In the app, click the hamburger menu (â˜°) â†’ Settings â†’ Clear Cache
# Or press 'C' key
```

## Development

### Watch for file changes (auto-reload)
Streamlit automatically watches for file changes and reloads!

### Debug mode
```bash
streamlit run app.py --logger.level=debug
```

### Custom config
Create `.streamlit/config.toml`:
```toml
[theme]
primaryColor = "#4CAF50"
backgroundColor = "#FFFFFF"
secondaryBackgroundColor = "#F0F2F6"

[server]
port = 8501
```

## Deployment

See [STREAMLIT_GUIDE.md](docs/STREAMLIT_GUIDE.md) for deployment options.

## Architecture

The Streamlit app maintains the same clean architecture:
- **Models**: Data structures (unchanged)
- **Interfaces**: Service contracts (unchanged)
- **Services**: Business logic (unchanged)
- **Infrastructure**: OpenAI client, persistence
- **UI**: Streamlit interface (new!)

This demonstrates the power of SOLID principles - we added a completely new UI without changing any core business logic!
